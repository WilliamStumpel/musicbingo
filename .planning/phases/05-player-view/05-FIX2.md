  <name>Fix UAT-004: Grid cell text clipping</name>
  <files>musicbingo_host/src/components/PlayerCallBoard.css</files>
  <action>
The current CSS has `-webkit-line-clamp` but text is still clipping abruptly. The issue is likely:
1. The `clamp()` font sizes at large viewport widths (especially the 1920px+ media query override to fixed 32px/20px) may cause text to overflow
2. The grid cells need a fixed max-height to prevent unexpected overflow

Fix approach:
1. Remove the fixed font-size overrides in the 1920px+ media query for grid cells - let clamp() handle all sizes
2. Ensure grid cells have proper height constraints with `max-height` and `min-height`
3. Add `text-overflow: ellipsis` to both title and artist (belt and suspenders)
4. Ensure the cell padding doesn't cause overflow issues

Key CSS changes:
- `.grid-cell`: Add `max-height: 120px` to constrain cell height
- `.grid-cell-title`: Keep clamp() but ensure it works with ellipsis properly
- `.grid-cell-artist`: Same treatment
- Remove or adjust the 1920px+ fixed font size overrides that bypass clamp()
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Start host app: `cd musicbingo_host && npm start`
2. Load a game with songs that have long titles
3. Open Player View popup
4. Mark songs with long titles as played
5. Verify text truncates cleanly with "..." and doesn't overflow cell boundaries
  </verify>
  <done>Grid cell text truncates with ellipsis instead of clipping abruptly; text stays within cell boundaries at all viewport sizes</done>
</task>
</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Grid cells show text truncation with ellipsis (...)
- [ ] Text stays within cell boundaries at all viewport sizes
- [ ] Long titles and artists are readable (not cut off mid-character)
- [ ] Host app builds without errors

- Ready for re-verification
