  <name>Task 1: Create PlayerCallBoard component with grid layout</name>
  <files>musicbingo_host/src/components/PlayerCallBoard.jsx, musicbingo_host/src/components/PlayerCallBoard.css</files>
  <action>
Create PlayerCallBoard component optimized for TV viewing:

Props: songs, playedSongs, playedOrder, nowPlaying (same as host CallBoard)

Layout:
- Grid of played songs (4 columns on large screens, responsive)
- Each cell shows song title (primary) and artist (secondary)
- Cells fill grid in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- Max ~20 visible songs (older ones scroll off or hide)

Styling:
- Large text: Title 28-32px, Artist 18-20px
- High contrast: white text on dark (#1a1a1a) cards
- Played songs have subtle green border/accent
- Generous padding and spacing for readability
- Card-based design with rounded corners

Do NOT include "now playing" in the grid - that will be a separate prominent section.

  <name>Task 2: Create Now Playing hero section</name>
  <files>musicbingo_host/src/components/PlayerCallBoard.jsx, musicbingo_host/src/components/PlayerCallBoard.css</files>
  <action>
Add prominent "Now Playing" section above the grid:

Layout:
- Large hero section (takes ~30% of viewport height)
- Centered content
- Song title: 48-64px, bold, white
- Artist: 32-40px, muted color (#aaa)
- Pulsing border/glow animation (amber/yellow #ffc107)
- "NOW PLAYING" label above song info

When no song is playing:
- Show "Ready to play" or similar placeholder
- Dimmed state, no animation

Animation:
- Subtle pulsing glow around the now playing container
- Scale/fade animation when song changes
  </action>
  <verify>Now Playing section prominently displays current song with animation</verify>
  <done>Now Playing hero section with large text and pulsing animation</done>

  <name>Task 3: Integrate PlayerCallBoard into PlayerView</name>
  <files>musicbingo_host/src/pages/PlayerView.jsx, musicbingo_host/src/pages/PlayerView.css</files>
  <action>
Update PlayerView to use PlayerCallBoard:

Layout restructure:
- Header: Game name, song count (small, top bar)
- Main area: PlayerCallBoard component (now playing + grid)
- Footer: Reserved for pattern display (next plan)

Pass game state to PlayerCallBoard:
- songs, playedSongs, playedOrder, nowPlaying from polling hook

Responsive behavior:
- 1920x1080 (full HD): Optimal layout
- 1280x720 (720p): Slightly smaller fonts
- Handle different aspect ratios gracefully
  </action>
  <verify>PlayerView displays PlayerCallBoard with now playing and played songs grid</verify>
  <done>PlayerView shows complete call board with now playing hero and played songs grid</done>
</task>
